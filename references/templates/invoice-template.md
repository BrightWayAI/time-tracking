# Invoice Template

_Edit this template to match your firm's invoice format. The starter is generic._

When `/generate-invoices` runs, it produces a structured invoice draft using this template. Replace `[bracketed]` fields with actual values.

## Customizing this template

Common edits:
- **Brand styling** — if your firm has brand colors, font choices, etc., the docx skill (when called by `/generate-invoices`) can apply them on conversion. Adjust the brand-pass logic in your firm's `core-ops` user-context if applicable.
- **Tax rules** — different jurisdictions and product types have different rules. Edit the line-item formula and tax line accordingly.
- **Multi-currency** — if you bill in multiple currencies, add currency to the user-context's per-client config and update the template to render the currency code.
- **Logo / signature image** — handled at docx-conversion time, not in this markdown template.

The plugin produces structured invoice data per client; this template defines the shape of that data. The actual document (.docx, .pdf) is produced by your invoice skill or whatever tool you use for final delivery.
